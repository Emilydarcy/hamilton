<h2> The story</h2>   


<div class="mainFlex">
<p>Hamilton tells the life story of Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Set against the backdrop of the American Revolution, it explores Hamilton’s rise from a poor orphan in the Caribbean to becoming one of the most influential figures in early American politics.
    The musical delves into Hamilton’s contributions to shaping the American financial system, his complex relationships with fellow Founding Fathers like Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, and his dramatic personal life, including his marriage to Eliza Schuyler and his tragic death in a duel with Burr.
